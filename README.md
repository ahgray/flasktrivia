### 4. Project Structure

Ensure your project has the following structure:

```
trivia-game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main Flask application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies

    {
        "id": "unique_id_001",
        "category": "stem",
        "subcategory": "Computer Science",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "question": "Your question here?",
        "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Explanation of the answer",
        "funFact": "An interesting fact!"
    }
]
```

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 7. Play the Game!

2. Answer questions by clicking on options
3. Get immediate feedback with explanations
4. View your final score and review answers

## üåê Deployment to Render.com

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push your code:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Ensure Required Files

Make sure these files are in your repository:

**requirements.txt:**
```
Flask==3.0.0
Werkzeug==3.0.1
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

**render.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: trivia-game
    runtime: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: 3.11.0
```

### 3. Deploy to Render

1. Sign up for a free account at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your trivia game repository
5. Render will auto-detect the configuration from `render.yaml`
6. Click **"Create Web Service"**

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- Render will automatically build and deploy your application
- The process takes 2-5 minutes
- You'll get a URL like `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### 5. Important Notes for Render

- **Free Tier Limitations**: 
  - Apps spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - First request after spin-down takes 30-50 seconds
  - 750 hours of free usage per month
  
- **Database Persistence**: 
  - SQLite database resets on each deployment
  - For persistent stats, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can set these in Render's dashboard:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key (Render will auto-generate if not set)
- `PORT`: Port number (Render sets this automatically)

### Customization

1. **Styling**: Edit the CSS in `templates/index.html`
2. **Questions**: Modify `questions.json`
3. **Game Logic**: Update `app.py`

## üìä Database

The app uses SQLite to track question statistics:
- Times each question has been shown
- Number of correct/incorrect answers
- Global accuracy percentages

**Note**: On Render's free tier, the database resets with each deployment. For persistent data, consider:
- Upgrading to a paid Render plan
- Using Render's PostgreSQL database
- Using an external database service

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Local Development Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**:
   ```bash
   # Change port in app.py
   app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
   ```

2. **Module Not Found**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure virtual environment is activated
   # Reinstall requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Questions Not Loading**:
   - Check `questions.json` is in the root directory
   - Verify JSON format is correct
   - Check file encoding is UTF-8

### Render Deployment Issues

1. **Build Fails**:
   - Check `requirements.txt` is committed
   - Verify Python version in `render.yaml`
   - Check build logs in Render dashboard

2. **App Crashes**:
   - Check if `gunicorn` is in requirements
   - Verify `app:app` is correct in start command
   - Review logs in Render dashboard

3. **Slow Initial Load**:
   - Normal for free tier (cold start)
   - Consider upgrading for always-on service

- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Flask framework for the backend
- SQLite for lightweight database
- Modern CSS for the beautiful UI

## ü§ñ AI Question Generation

The app includes an AI-powered question generator that uses OpenAI's GPT model to create new trivia questions.

### Web Interface
After completing a game, users can generate new questions by:
1. Entering a category on the results screen
2. Clicking "Generate Question"
3. The AI will create a new question that's automatically added to the database

### Command Line Interface
The question generator can also be used standalone:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Run the generator
python question_generator.py

# Follow the prompts to generate questions interactively
```

### Module Usage
You can also import and use the generator in your own code:

```python
from question_generator import QuestionGenerator

# Initialize generator
generator = QuestionGenerator(api_key="your-key", model="gpt-4")

# Generate a question
question = generator.generate_question("Ancient History")

# Save to questions.json
generator.save_question(question)
```

## üí° Future Enhancements

- [x] AI-powered question generation
- [ ] User accounts and personal statistics
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Timer mode
- [ ] Multiplayer support
- [ ] More question categories
- [ ] Achievement system
